# Smart-Coach
This project aims to support football coaches in making better decisions by automatically analyzing players‚Äô emotions and physical movements from match videos.  It uses AI models to detect facial emotions and track each player‚Äôs speed, direction, and position over time. Then, it combines both  data to generate  psychological  insights by LLM.
### üîç Built With:
- Python
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers
- MTCNN / DeepSort
- ResNet18
- Google Colab

### üèÜ Built During:
AI League Hackathon by Sky & Tuwaiq Academy

### üìÇ Files:
- Faces_dataset.zip: A Custom labeled dataset containing facial images of football plyers and corresponding emotion labels used for training.
- model.py: trains A custom emotion classification model (based on pretrained resnet18) on a manually collected dataset of football plyers' facial expressions.
- emotion_model.pth: The trained model.
- vedio_processing.py: Processes video and tracks players to classify their emotions and detect theit physical info, then generate a json report that contains this information.
- Final_report_named.json: Example of a JSON report generated by video processing code.
- LLM_feedback.py: Generates a player psychological feedback using local LLM.
